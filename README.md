## Technologies Used
For my portfolio, I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery, with some elements from Materialize.CSS and an animation from animate.css. 

## The Process
I pictured a simple and clean design but with bursts of color and irregular shapes to maintain the viewer's attention. The parallax and the sticky navbar that adjusts color and opacity are the first things to catch your eye when you land on the page, and the color blocks keep you scrolling. 

## With Time
I plan to add some textures and additional shapes behind some images or headers.
