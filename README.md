## Technologies Used
For my portfolio, I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery, with some elements from Materialize.CSS and an animation from animate.css. 

## The Process
I pictured a simple and clean design but with bursts of color and irregular shapes to maintain the viewer's attention. The parallax and the sticky navbar that adjusts color and opacity are the first things to catch your eye when you land on the page, and the color blocks keep you scrolling. 

## With Time
I plan to add a skills section with tech stacks I've learned. I also need to format my project section in a more compact way, such as in a carousel, so it's more scalable in preparation for future projects. Lastly, I will add some textures and additional shapes behind some images or headers.

## Challenges & Wins
A big challenge for me was utilizing Materialize.css for the first time and customizing it to suit my tastes. Quite some time was spent on the parallax effect of the banner image and the opacity and color transition of the navbar as you scroll past the banner. Clipping the corners of large colorblocks also helped to add interest.
